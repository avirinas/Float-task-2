                    <p>Sir Isaac Newton PRS was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer,
                        alchemist, theologian, and author (described in his time as a "natural philosopher") widely
                        recognised as one of the
                        greatest mathematicians and physicists of all time and among the most influential scientists. He was
                        a key figure in the
                        philosophical revolution known as the Enlightenment. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia
                        Mathematica (Mathematical
                        Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, established classical mechanics.</p><br><br>

                    <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest
                        physicists of all
                        time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important
                        contributions to the
                        development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two
                        pillars of modern
                        physics.His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been
                        dubbed "the
                        world's most famous equation". </p><br><br>

                    <p>Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist
                        best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply
                        system.Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical
                        oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat,
                        one of the first-ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities
                        and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures.</p><br><br>
